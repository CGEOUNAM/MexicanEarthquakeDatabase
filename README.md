The Mexican earthquake source parameter database: a new resource for
earthquake physics and seismic hazard analyses in Mexico


Abstract We present a database of earthquake source parameters obtained with two different methods: finite-fault slip inversions and spectral analysis. Results for the first method, include 49 slip distributions of 33 earthquakes (6.4 < Mw < 8.2) previously studied by several authors. From these finite-fault models, we determine and report the following parameters: effective fault dimensions, average and maximum displacement, radiated seismic energy, number of asperities, combined asperity area to effective rupture area ratio, maximum stress, stress on the asperities and on background areas. For the second method, the database includes 1041 events (0.2 < Mw < 8.0) that occurred in the three main tectonic environments of Mexico (the Gulf of Baja California, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and the Middle American Trench, respectively) from 1973 to 2017. Based on spectral analysis, the database provides the following information: location, seismic moment (moment magnitude), stress drop, corner frequency, fault radius, seismic displacement, radiated seismic energy and energy to moment ratio. This database may be employed to improve or develop seismic hazard models in Mexico as well as to make relative comparison studies based on data generated from similar methodology. The database has the potencial of being expanded as new information becomes available.
